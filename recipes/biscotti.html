    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Biscotti are Italian almond cookies. 
        They are baked twice, which gives them their signature hard and crunchy texture. 
        Biscotti are traditionally dipping in a drink before eating.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablesppon anise extract, or 3 drops anise oil</li>
        <li>3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease two cookie sheets or line with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Beat sugar, oil, eggs, and anise extract together in a medium bowl until well-blended. Combine flour and baking powder in a separate bowl; stir into egg mixture to form a heavy dough.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into two equal pieces. Form each piece into a log the length of a cookie sheet. Place one log on each of the prepared sheets; and press dough down to 1/2-inch thickness.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer logs to wire racks; let sit until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slice each log crosswise into about eighteen 1/2-inch-thick slices. Place slices cut-sides up back on the cookie sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake until lightly toasted and golden brown, 6 to 10 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
